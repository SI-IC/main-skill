# main-skill

Personal Claude Code workflow rules — auto-injected into every session via a SessionStart hook.

## What it does

Makes Claude Code follow a consistent workflow on every non-trivial task:

1. **Triage** — invokes the right skill first (debug for bugs, brainstorming for features, ui-ux for UI work).
2. **Alignment** — discusses logic with the user before touching code; surfaces edge cases upfront.
3. **Execution** — implements autonomously, then self-verifies (tests including edge cases, security, code review, linters, docs).

Full rules: [`skills/workflow-rules/SKILL.md`](skills/workflow-rules/SKILL.md).

## Install

On any machine with Claude Code:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add SI-IC/main-skill
claude plugin install main-skill@main-skill
```

First command registers this repo as a Claude Code marketplace; second installs the `main-skill` plugin from it. The plugin's `SessionStart` hook fires on every new session — cats `SKILL.md` and `CLAUDE.md` into Claude's context automatically. No per-project config needed.

## Updates

**Maintainer workflow** (when editing rules in this repo):

1. Edit `SKILL.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / whatever.
2. **Bump `version` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`** (patch increment — `1.0.1` → `1.0.2`). Without a version bump, Claude Code will not refresh the cached plugin content on consumer machines.
3. Commit + push.

**Consumer workflow** — nothing to do. The plugin ships a synchronous SessionStart hook (`hooks/session-start.sh`) that does a cheap `git ls-remote` against the marketplace clone on every session start; if remote moved, it runs `claude plugin update` inline and then cats `SKILL.md` + `CLAUDE.md` from the freshest cached version. So **the current session sees new rules immediately** — no second restart required. When an update actually lands, the hook also prints a one-liner `main-skill updated to vX.Y.Z` so the upgrade is visible (Claude Code's `/plugin` UI is frozen at process start and won't show the new version until you restart `claude`). 60-second concurrent-run guard prevents thrashing across windows.

Opt out of the update check with `export MAIN_SKILL_AUTO_UPDATE=0`.

## Editing the rules

Edit [`skills/workflow-rules/SKILL.md`](skills/workflow-rules/SKILL.md), commit, push. All installed instances pick up the change on their next session start.

## Structure

```
main-skill/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   ├── plugin.json         # plugin manifest
│   └── marketplace.json    # marketplace manifest (makes the repo installable)
├── skills/
│   └── workflow-rules/
│       └── SKILL.md        # the core three-phase workflow rules
├── hooks/
│   ├── hooks.json          # SessionStart + Stop hook registration
│   ├── session-start.sh    # synchronous remote-SHA check + plugin update + emit latest rules
│   └── verify-frontend.js  # Stop hook: blocks "done" claims on frontend edits without headless verification
├── CLAUDE.md               # miscellaneous rule additions (auto-loaded alongside SKILL.md)
└── README.md
```

`SKILL.md` holds the structured workflow (triage / align / execute). `CLAUDE.md` is a free-form addendum for rules that don't fit that structure — edit it, commit, push, and it propagates to every session everywhere.
